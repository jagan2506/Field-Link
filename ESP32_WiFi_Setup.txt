ESP32 WiFi Connection Steps:

1. HARDWARE SETUP:
   - Connect ESP32 to computer via USB cable
   - Ensure ESP32 has power (LED should be on)

2. ARDUINO IDE SETUP:
   - Install Arduino IDE
   - Add ESP32 board: File → Preferences → Additional Board Manager URLs:
     https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
   - Tools → Board → Boards Manager → Search "ESP32" → Install
   - Select Board: Tools → Board → ESP32 Dev Module

3. WIFI CREDENTIALS:
   In the ESP32 code, change these lines:
   
   const char* ssid = "YOUR_WIFI_NAME";        // Your WiFi network name
   const char* password = "YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD"; // Your WiFi password

   Example:
   const char* ssid = "Home_WiFi";
   const char* password = "mypassword123";

4. UPLOAD CODE:
   - Connect ESP32 via USB
   - Select correct COM port: Tools → Port → COM3 (or available port)
   - Click Upload button (arrow icon)
   - Wait for "Done uploading" message

5. CHECK CONNECTION:
   - Open Serial Monitor: Tools → Serial Monitor
   - Set baud rate to 115200
   - Press ESP32 reset button
   - You should see:
     "Connecting to WiFi..."
     "WiFi connected!"
     "IP address: 192.168.1.XXX"

6. FIND ESP32 IP ADDRESS:
   - Note the IP address from Serial Monitor (e.g., 192.168.1.105)
   - Update this IP in your React app:
     const [iotSensorManager] = useState(new IoTSensorManager('192.168.1.105'));

7. TEST CONNECTION:
   - Open browser and go to: http://192.168.1.105
   - You should see: "ESP32 Sensor Server Running"
   - Test sensors: http://192.168.1.105/sensors

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If WiFi won't connect: Check SSID and password spelling
- If upload fails: Press and hold BOOT button while uploading
- If no IP shown: Check if WiFi network is 2.4GHz (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- If webpage can't connect: Ensure ESP32 and computer are on same network
